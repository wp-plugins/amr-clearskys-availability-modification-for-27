Clearskys Property Availability calendar modified for 2.7.1 with wordpress in own directory, shortcodes, multiple properties (rudimentary).

== Description ==

Please see [Clearskys](http://dev.clearskys.net/Wordpress/Availability)  for all functioning.  I altered as noted for my own purposes - I could not wait till they delivered a new version.   I took some extra time to offer it up to the wordpress community as it seemed there were a few folk needing it.   If this fix was helpful, please donate, or write a credit post linking back to my site!  Don't forget to acknowledge the original authors.


== Version History ==

= Version 1.1a =
*   fixed the clearsksy file and directory references so css has no problems
*   added strong to default css in config for booked class so will at least highlight if no css.
*   tried to fix their feeds but it is not picking them up - if anyone wants to have a go at seeing why or is happy for to pay me - I'll look further.  One can add a shortcode [amr-clearskys-bookings property=1 months=2 feedlink="ical" ]  , but the resultant link does not work.  Or
[amr-clearskys-bookings property=1 months=2 feedlink="rss" ]  
Also happy to add a form for adding properties if someone wants to contribute to that exercise.   Meanwhile addd properties by updating the amr_props.php file - just add another line.

= Version 1.1a =
*   fixed to allow for wordpress in own directory, and relocated content directory
*   fix alternate logic of listing so shades will alternate
*   moved admin links to one section in admin  menu under Bookings for ease of user
*   allowed for additional properties through rudimentary include file - hopefully clearskys will provide a version soon.
*   changed to shortcode usage to upgrade and to avoid problems with validation (else wordpress insert a <p> before and </p> after - this breaks the validation.
*   developed a css file for the page calendar - add this to your standard stylesheet.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
